# Production-Optimization
Solve a Linear Programming Model using Excel

This is a computing project as part of the Linear Optmization course at the University of Washington. The end goal is the find find the best combination of production to maximize profit, given a certain number of constraints. I utilize Excel to set up the model and use the solver to find a solution and produce a sensitivity report. Attached is the Excel file, and a word document that summarizes the results.
